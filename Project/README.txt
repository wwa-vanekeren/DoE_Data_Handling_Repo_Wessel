For the final project of the course Data Handling, DoE and Statistical Analysis Spring 2023 I will do the following:
1. Create a database containing the physicochemical properties of the liquid electrolytes for my PhD.
	a) This database contains information regarding the salts, solvents and additives.
	b) This database contains information regarding experimental results of conductivity and viscosity measurements.
2. Create a DoE for the phyisochemical properties of the liquid electrolytes. The liquid electrolytes are based on Li or Na salts, a non-flammable solvent TEP and additives.
The DoE should provide insights in the effect of different salts on the ionic conductivity and viscosity. I would like to provide insights in the most important factors for the determination of ionic conductivity and viscosity, such as dielectric constant or type of anion (size of anion etc.).
